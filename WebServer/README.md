# JMS.VCR.NET

Acually this assembly only provides the infrastructure to start the VCR.NET recording service assembly in a WebApi environment. It shows all the necessary preparations to make it work properly. Actually this is used for the current server system but it may be necessary to adapt the code for other needs.

The assembly itself provides features like a full server restart or OpenAPI configuration using the swagger libraries. Beside the VCR.NET HTTP/REST API the server started will although host the VCR.NET web application.
