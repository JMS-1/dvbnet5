# JMS.DVB.NET.Ubuntu

The assembly provides a DVB.NET hardware abstraction to access DVB devices on a linux system running the [DVB.NET Proxy Server](https://github.com/JMS-1/dvbnet-ubuntu-server). The special TCP protolcol definded by DVB.NET currently only supported DVB receiption via satellite. Although the proxy server should be capable of running on any linux only Ubuntu and Fedora are tested at this point of time.
