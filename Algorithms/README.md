# JMS.DVB.NET.Algorithms

Two algorithms are implemented here that make working with DVB devices easier:

- The **channel updater** esp. with the support of network search. This algorithm was developed specifically for the use with DVB.NET.
- A **scheduling planner** for recordings for individual recordings and recurring recordings but also maintenance tasks such as updating the channel list or the program guide. The algorithm is very general and is more or less independent of DVB.NET due to special abstractions.
